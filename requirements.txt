# SignalSight - Traffic Light Detection System
# Main project dependencies
#
# IMPORTANT: numpy is pinned to <2.0.0 because the system-installed picamera2 and
# simplejpeg packages (installed via apt) are compiled against numpy 1.x C API.
# Installing numpy 2.x will cause binary incompatibility errors during import.
# The venv is created with --system-site-packages to access picamera2.
